Simple webpage to display data from Billboard Hot 100 charts with filtering

Links to youtube and lyrics for each song

Created using Hot 100 data from here:
https://github.com/mhollingshead/billboard-hot-100

This is a still a work in progress so don't expect it to work out of the box yet (or at all).

Part of my experiment here was to practice using ChatGPT to write code that I wouldn't have been able to do myself
(the javascript and htmx elements) so I'm sure a lot of the non-python code has room for improvement

If you have uv installed already:
```commandline
./src/app.py
```

### Running tests
Install the requirements and run `pytest`.
```bash
pytest
```
